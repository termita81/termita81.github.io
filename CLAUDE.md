# Javascript style

1. Do not include semicolons at the end of Javascript statement, unless necessary
2. Avoid un-necessary comments, that state the obvious. Prefer comments that explain the why, rather than the what or the how, unless the code is complicated
3. Avoid functions that do nothing but call other functions, unless it helps with code structure or brings some other tangible benefits
