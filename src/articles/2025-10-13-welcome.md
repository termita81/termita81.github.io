# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and ideas here.

## What is this blog about?

This blog is a simple, clean space where I can write about:

- Technology and programming
- Personal projects
- Ideas and reflections
- Anything else I find interesting

## Features

The blog supports **markdown** formatting, including:

- *Italics* and **bold** text
- Code blocks

Here's a code example:

```javascript

  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```
